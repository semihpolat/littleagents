### Why This List Exists

We all enjoy browsing through big shiny lists of tools. The problem is they often eat up our time, drown us in noise, and leave us with things we never actually use. That is exactly what I wanted to fix.

This list works differently. Only tools that prove their value make it in. Either I have tested and enjoyed them myself, or you have vouched for them with proof like a PR request. If a tool gets no love, it disappears. If it delivers, it stays.

To save you even more time, I will personally test them whenever possible, give them a rating, and share how long it really takes on average to finish a task. No hype, only practical results.

I built this list because I needed it myself while working in Silicon Valley. Now it is here for you as well. Hopefully it saves you as much frustration as it saves me.

3. Review and approve each command before execution.
Where it breaks: long-running tasks can stall; sandboxing is thin.
Alternatives: OpenAI Code Interpreter, AutoGPT.
